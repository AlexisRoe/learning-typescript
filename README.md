# learning-typescript

Part of my path to learn typescript, this repository follows the Online Tutorial made by [TechZ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2S7KicQMgJaVY1Kjw1druQ). In this project we build a To-Do App and a Rick-and-Morty-API

## Installation and Config

### configuration if you start from scratch

Because I start with the ready-to-go Image

```node
npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
```

I don`t need the Setup from the tutorial üòù ....

configuration of webpack.config.js

```js
const path = require('path');
const rules = [
    {
        test: /\.tsx?/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        loader: 'babel-loader',
    },
];

module.exports = {
    target: 'web',
    mode: 'development',
    entry: './src/index.tsx',
    output: {
        path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'build'),
        filename: 'bundle.js',
    },
    module: { rules },
    resolve: { extensions: ['.ts', '.tsx', '.js'] },
    devServer: {
        contentBase: './',
        port: 5000,
    },
};
```

configuration of .babelrc

```json
{
    "presets": ["@babel/env", "@babel/react", "@babel/typescript"]
}
```

installation manually

```node
npm i @bable/core @bable/preset/env @bable/preset-react @bable/preset-typescript webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader react react-dom @types/react @types/react-dom
```

change scripts

```json
...
    "scripts": {
        "start": "webpack-dev-server --open",
        "build": "webpack"
    }
...
```

### start with this repository

```node
git clone https://github.com/AlexisRoe/learning-typescript
cd learning-typescript
code .
```

## To-Do-List

First project to learn typescript in a react app is a good old To-Do-List

Here some learnings from that

### 1. JSX.Element

a component, which returns jsx is called "JSX:Element" for the return value

### 2. useState

the useState-Hook will be defined with a generic useState<string> for example. This generic is defined in the @types/react. The generic defines the default value, which will be stored in the state or returned by the function (set...).

Another way of definition is - It means the state have to be an array and each element of the array is defined by the interface "ToDo"

```tsx

interface ToDo {
    text: string,
    complete: boolean,
}

...

const [todos, setTodos] = useState<ToDo[]>([])
```

### 3. FormElements

A submit event of a form is definded as

`````tsx
type FormElem = React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>;
...
const handleSubmit = (event: FormElem): void => {
        event.preventDefault();
        setValue("");
    }
````

And a onChange event of an inputfield is defined as
````tsx
type ChangeEvent = React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>;
...
const handleChange = (event: ChangeEvent): void => {
        setValue(event.target.value)
    }
`````

## Rick and Morty API

Instead of using the Redux library, the tutor uses the same methology and the useReducer Hook. 

Here are some learning from that...

### 4. useReducer in Action

the reducer hook takes two arguments, a function for handling the state, and the default value. It returns the state and function to change the state. This function usually called dispatch got called by giving it the type of action and in some cases a payload. In this case it has to be action = {type: "ADD", payload: data}....

approach with if¬¥s - default action / state

```js
...
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    if (action === "ADD") {
        return state + 1
    }
    if (action === "SUB") {
        return state - 1
    }
    if (action === "Add") {
        return state = 0
    }
    return state;
}
...
```

approach with object/key - no default action

```jsx
const reducer =  (state, action) => {
    const obj = {
        "ADD": state + 1,
        "SUB": state - 1,
        "RES": state = 0
    }

    return obj[action];
}
...

const [count, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, 0);

return (
    <>
        <div>{count}</div>
        <button onClick={()=> dispatch("ADD")}>+</button>
        ...
    </>
)
```

approach with switch/case

```js
const reducer = (state, action) => {
    switch (action) {
        case "ADD":
            return state + 1;
        case "SUB":
            return state -1;
        case "RES":
            return state = 0;
        default:
            return state;
    }
}
...
```

### dispatch function

````ts
type Dispatch = React.Dispatch<IAction>
...
store: {state: IState, dispatch: Dispatch
````

### payload type
